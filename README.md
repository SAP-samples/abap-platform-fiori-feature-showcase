![App List Report](/Images/app-list.jpg)

The focus of this project is to demonstrate the features of annotation-driven SAP Fiori Elements for oData V4, using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). The oData V4 app has been developed to be transactional- and draft- enabled.

To run the feature showcase app, pull the source code from GitHub into your system (see instructions below for different system types), locate the Service Binding and publish it locally. You can start the app preview by selecting the Root node. You can also run it by building your own Fiori app using the SAP Business Application Studio and connecting to the backend via the service binding.

When you see a feature that you would like to implement, copy or take note of the search term (e.g., **#SearchTermExample**) and perform a search in the [Guide](/../../wiki/Feature-Showcase-App-Guide). You will be presented with 

* a short description of the feature, 
* code snippets and where to find them in the source code, 
* and in some cases, a link to the official RAP documentation for more information.

Alternatively, you can search for an annotation in the [Guide](/../../wiki/Feature-Showcase-App-Guide), get the search term, and use it to locate the UI feature in the app. If the annotation cannot be found, it could simply mean that it is not showcased in the current release.

A number of issues have been identified and documented in the Wiki [Identified Constraints](/../../wiki/Identified-Constraints).

A corresponding app built using CAP can be found at https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-feature-showcase.
